CSV to strings.xml lets you easily manage multiple languages in apps powered by Appcelerator. 
As input it takes a CSV file and as output it produces separate language files.

The CSV file should be of the following format for an app translated into english and swedish:

Input, strings.csv:
+-------------------+-----------+----------+
| string            | en        | sv       |
+-------------------+-----------+----------+
| greeting_text     | Hello!    | Tjena!   +
+-------------------+-----------+----------+

Output:

en/en.xml
sv/sv.xml
