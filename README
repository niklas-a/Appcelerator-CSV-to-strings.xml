CSV to strings.xml lets you easily manage multiple languages in appcelerator powered apps. 

As input it takes one CSV file that can easily be created using Excel and as output it produces the language files.

The CSV file should be of the following format for an app translated into english and swedish:

+-------------------+-----------+----------+
| string            | en        | sv       |
+-------------------+-----------+----------+
| greeting_text     | Hello!    | Tjena!   +
+-------------------+-----------+----------+
